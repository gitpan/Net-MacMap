NAME
       Net::MacMap - a module used to determine the vendor of an
       interface based on the MAC address.

SYNOPSIS
        my $vendor = Net::MacMap::vendor('00:D0:BA:01:49:B6');
        # $vendor is 'CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.'


DESCRIPTION
       This module determines the vendor name for a particular
       MAC address prefix.  There is only one function in this
       module, vendor(), which takes a scalar argument of the MAC
       address prefix represented as a base16 string.  Only the
       first 24 bits of the MAC address are needed and any
       remaining bits will be ignored.  Colons or hyphens are
       allowed in the MAC address.
